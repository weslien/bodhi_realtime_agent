features:
  - title: Real-Time Voice
    details: Bidirectional audio streaming via a provider-agnostic LLMTransport interface. Supports Google Gemini Live and OpenAI Realtime APIs with server-side turn detection, pluggable STT providers, and normalized usage events.
  - title: Multi-Agent
    details: Define multiple agents with distinct personas and tool sets. Transfer between them mid-conversation with automatic context preservation.
  - title: Function Tools
    details: Inline (blocking) and background (non-blocking) tool execution. Zod schema validation, timeout, cancellation, and abort signals. Artifact pipeline for cross-tool data flow.
  - title: Persistent Agents
    details: Relay subagent pattern for bridging to stateful external agents like Claude Code and OpenClaw. Session routing, concurrent task isolation, and write-lock serialization.
  - title: Memory
    details: Automatic extraction and persistence of durable user facts across sessions. LLM-powered distillation with configurable triggers.
  - title: Observability
    details: Type-safe EventBus and lifecycle hooks for logging, metrics, and debugging. Zero overhead when unattached.
  - title: Multimodal
    details: Voice, text input, file upload, image generation, and artifact attachments on a single WebSocket connection. Mixed-mode interaction out of the box.
  - title: Custom Speech
    details: Swap native model audio for streaming TTS providers such as Cartesia or ElevenLabs, with sentence buffering, barge-in cancellation, word timing, and automatic resampling.
  - title: Telephony
    details: Bridge browser sessions to Twilio phone calls, accept inbound phone callers, and transfer between AI audio and external human audio while preserving session context.
